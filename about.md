I am a PhD student in Industrial Engineering at University of Washington. My research interests are applying methods of artificial intelligence to healthcare problems. My work focuses on building clinical decision support (CDS) systems, the computer assistant to the diagnosis of diseases. 

The methods I use a lot in my research include (partially observable) Markov decision process, reinforcement learning, etc.
